# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# 3.times do |a|
#   a = Question.create(title: 'interesting question', body: 'bla-bla-bla-bla')
# end

# Add constatns for implementation reputation of users
# constants = ReputationConstant.create([{value: 1, code: 'one_oint'},{value: 2, code: 'two_points'}, {value: 3, code: 'three_points'} ])
